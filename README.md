# PLANT YOUR REVENGE
!(https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTAyODY3NS81ODk4MTQ4LnBuZw==/347x500/cLGRx8.png)
- A short tower defense inspired puzzle game where you help the enemies win.
- Made in 2 days, using this asset pack for the visuals: https://www.kenney.nl/assets/monochrome-rpg
- Made in Godot 3.

## WARNING:
When I tested the game again, the pathfinding of the enemies was different; luckily, all the puzzles were still solvable.
I think the enemies will behave differently depending on what version of Godot 3 you are using.
